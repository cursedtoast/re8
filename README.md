# Instructions

Edit your splits and change the game name to "Resident Evil Village". A message should display below "Start Timer at:" that notifies you that auto splitting and load removal is available . Click the "Activate" button.

After activating the RE8 autosplitter, click "Settings". Place a checkmark next to every split you want to use.

Afterwards, create your splits/segments. Name them anything you want (just make sure you have one split for each checkmarked autosplit setting). Order them however you'd like.

Right click Livesplit -> Compare Against -> Game Time.

Any problems? Reach out to me.

# I have a split request?

Great, reach out to me through the RE Speedrunning discord, and I'll see what I can do.

# Something didn't split or split at the wrong time.

Make sure you have the split checkmarked as explained above. If that doesn't work, or if a split of yours split at the wrong time, contact me.
